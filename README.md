# ToDo_App 
This project is about managing a To do tasks, where the user is able to add a new task, edit it or remove it if he needed to .
The application was built with React Js to manage the UI and the JSON server to help me create fake REST API for my application. Here I used the axios library to make my 
requests and update my state regarding the response I got from the server . 
The application helped me master many JS features like promises, destruction and array methods, in addition to mastering the react hooks like useState hook and get used
to deal with props .
